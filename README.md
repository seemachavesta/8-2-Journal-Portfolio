This repository showcases my work in system analysis and design, specifically focusing on two projects completed during my coursework. These projects demonstrate my ability to gather and analyze business requirements and design systems that meet the needs of the client.
Submitted Documents
Project One: Business Requirements Document
This document outlines the business requirements for the DriverPass system, detailing the client's needs, system objectives, functional and nonfunctional requirements, and the overall purpose of the project.

Project Two: System Design Document
This document provides a comprehensive system design for the DriverPass project, including UML diagrams, technical requirements, and detailed descriptions of the system components necessary to meet the clientâ€™s requirements.

Brief Summary of the DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project was developed for a client who wanted a comprehensive system to help students pass their driving tests. The system combines online practice exams with on-the-road training, allowing students to schedule and track lessons, ensuring thorough preparation for their driving tests. This dual approach addresses the high failure rate by providing both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.

What I Did Well
In this project, I believe, I  accurately capturing the client's requirements and translating them into a detailed system design. My use of UML diagrams to model the system's architecture effectively communicated the design and ensured that all components were aligned with the client's needs.

Area for Improvement
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would focus on enhancing the nonfunctional requirements section. While I covered the essential aspects, I believe that incorporating more specific performance metrics and scalability considerations would improve the document's comprehensiveness. Additionally, I would work on improving my UML diagrams to ensure they more accurately and effectively represent the system's architecture. 

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
Understanding the user's needs is crucial in system design, as it ensures that the final product meets their expectations and resolves their pain points. For the DriverPass system, I interpreted the client's requirements and incorporated them into both the business requirements and system design documents. This attention to detail helped in creating a solution that was both effective and user-centric.

Approach to Designing Software
I belive, My approach to software design is systematic and user-focused. I begin by thoroughly understanding the client's needs, followed by detailed documentation of requirements. I then move on to creating UML diagrams to visually represent the system's architecture. In the future, I plan to incorporate more iterative design techniques, such as prototyping, to gather feedback early in the development process, ensuring that the final design is closely aligned with user expectations.
